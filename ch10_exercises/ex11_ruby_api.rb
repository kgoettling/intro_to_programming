#Q: Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which
# one you like best and why

#A: After going through a bunch of them, I really still like
#   ruby-doc.org the best. It has a very easy to use/understand 
#   interface. The explanations/examples are simple and easy.
#   I did find a secondary source that I might use in the future: 
#   ruby.sketchup.com, which also has a simple interface and a
#   very comprehensive API, but it's a little less user friendly
#   for a newer Ruby programmer.

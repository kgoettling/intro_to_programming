# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

#A: It's the process of taking possible errors in your program and
#   allowing the program to do continue executing when errors
#   are found. Sometimes you have things like user input that
#   make errors impossible to avoid, so if and when your program
#   does run into an error, it can deal with the error without
#   breaking the program.
